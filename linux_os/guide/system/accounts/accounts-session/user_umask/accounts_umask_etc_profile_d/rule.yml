title: 'Ensure the Default Umask is Set Correctly in /etc/profile.d/*.sh'

description: |-
    To ensure the default umask controlled by <tt>/etc/profile.d/</tt> is set properly,
    add or correct the <tt>umask</tt> setting in <tt>/etc/profile</tt> to read as follows:
    <pre>umask <sub idref="var_accounts_user_umask" /></pre>

rationale: |-
    The umask value influences the permissions assigned to files when they are created.
    A misconfigured umask value could result in files with excessive permissions that can be read or
    written to by unauthorized users.

severity: high

ocil_clause: 'the above command returns no output, or if the umask is configured incorrectly'

ocil: |-
    Verify the <tt>umask</tt> setting is configured correctly in the <tt>/etc/profile/*sh</tt> files by
    running the following command:
    <pre># grep "umask" /etc/profile.d/*sh</pre>
    All output must show the value of <tt>umask</tt> set as shown in the below:
    <pre># grep "umask" /etc/profile.d/*sh
    umask <sub idref="var_accounts_user_umask" /></pre>
