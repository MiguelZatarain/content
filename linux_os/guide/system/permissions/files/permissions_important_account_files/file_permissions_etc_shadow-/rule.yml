title: 'Verify Permissions on shadow- File'

description: |-
    {{{ describe_file_permissions(file="/etc/shadow-", perms="0644") }}}

rationale: |-
    If the <tt>/etc/shadow-</tt> file is writable by a group-owner or the
    world the risk of its compromise is increased. The file contains the list of
    accounts on the system and associated information, and protection of this file
    is critical for system security.
